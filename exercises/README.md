# Exercises

This directory contains 5 different exercises for learning (humanoid) robotics with pyCub simulator. The exercises
are approximately going from the easiest to the hardest. The first one 'Push the Ball' is, for sure, the simplest one
and is recommended to get started and acquainted with the simulator.  

You just need to download the directory (or directly the zip file [exercises.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rustlluk/pycub/refs/heads/master/exercises/exercises.zip)) 
and the exercises (you need, of course, the pyCub simulator installed). Every exercise contains a README file with the
instructions; .yaml config (or configs) for the given exercise and then exercise_X.py with the template code and
exercise_X_tester.py with code that tests your solution. It is recommended to always run the tester code, as it will
run the solution as it was intended. The solutions are not available publicly, but will be sent on demand if you 
contact the [author](mailto:lukas.rustler@fel.cvut.cz?subject=[pyCub]%20Exercises%20Solutions).
